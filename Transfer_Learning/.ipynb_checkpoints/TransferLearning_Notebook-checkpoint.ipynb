    "Training the network from scratch took around 4ms for each training step, i.e. each example took around 4 ms to go through the network and update the networks weights. By contrast using transfer learning each example takes about 1ms. This is due to the fact that most low-level features such as the ability of detecting edges, shapes, etc. are already learned from the previous network and the new network can focus on learning just the specific aspects of the new data. On the other hand training the network from scratch, requires the network to also learn these low-level features and so a big part of the computation is dedicated for this purpose. This fact would be crucial on a larger dataset where training a network might have a human-time limitation."
